# Experimental simulator for Mbed OS 5 applications

Ideas:

* Cross-compile Mbed OS applications with Emscripten.
* Use a custom C++ HAL which maps into JavaScript HAL.
* JavaScript HAL renders UI (board and components), similar to [mbed-js-simulator](https://github.com/janjongboom/mbed-js-simulator).
* Communication with node.js backend for more complex simulations - such as HTTP, BLE (where the computer is a real BLE peripheral) and Mbed Cloud simulation.

This is a very experimental project.

## How to run

TBD
